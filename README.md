# Sloped Pipe Volume Calculator

An interactive jupyter notebook that calculates the volume of water contained in a sloped pipe. 

The calculator uses user inputted values for pipe diameter, slope, invert elevation and lower level water elevation to calculate the volume of liquid contained in the pipe. 

The mathematics behind the volume calculation is from [planetcalc #1442](https://planetcalc.com/1442/). Full credit to Anton at planetcalc for the derivation.
